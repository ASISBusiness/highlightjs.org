Our previous website was created by Ivan Sagalaev, the original creator of highlight.js. Our old website served us well for years but due to age, became dated and hard to maintain. So, it's my pleasure to introduce our brand-new website powered by Next.js with a few new features that had been requested over the years. Our hope is, that with a more modern website, we'll be able to better maintain it and welcome more contributions from the community.

## Demo Page

Whenever you're navigating the internet for libraries to use in your project, you look for demos of how said libraries behave. But what about highlight.js? Where's the demo section where you can put code snippets and test out the highlighting behavior and our plethora of themes?

Say no more, introducing our new [demo](/demo) page where you can test code snippets and preview themes! But wait, there's more!

You can share the code snippets you write on our demo page! We're not storing these code snippets in any databases. It's all stored in the URL. So be mindful of sharing extremely large code snippets.

## Download Page

We've heard you! You want to be able to save your download configurations and have **us** bundle your package for you. Our download page now also supports specifying your languages **and** persisting them in the URL. Revisit the URL after a few weeks and if there's been any updates to the grammars you included, you'll automatically download the new bundle. ðŸŽ‰

## Open Source

Of course, our new website is [open source](https://github.com/highlightjs/highlightjs.org) and welcomes contributions! Just like the main highlight.js repo, create an issue to request features or discuss implementations of features if you'd like to contribute.

## More to Come

Now that our website has been modernized, we look forward to a pleasant style with more regular updates and features added.

Thank you for highlighting with highlight.js!
